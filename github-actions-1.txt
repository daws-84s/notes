Why GitHub Actions over Jenkins?

Code Test Deploy
1. If code is in Github, no need to manage another tool for CI
2. Scanning tools also can be configured along with code in Github. codeQL, Dependabot, secuirty tokens scanning, etc.
3. Integrations are easy
4. We can upload somefiles that can be verified and approved in the deployment process
